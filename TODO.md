## PROJECT TO DO LIST:
### Chunk does not simply power code, he takes many months and many moon cycles to pass through but just functions at a time
#### However the ideas remain forever, and one may grow old waiting for pyblog to be finished, but, the ideas are as good as new

* FIX CRONTAB IN THE `/cron` DIRECTORY!
	* and TEST it!
* Create new VM for new VPS / server and then make that blimey `install.sh` script work flawlessly!
	* With minimal expectations from any users
* Change that CSS thing for the `side-by-side-diff=1` where on the pages the word wrap for an extremely long 'word' with no spaces
	* That should be `text-wrap: breakword;` instead of just `text-wrap: wrap;`

### Get your hard hat and boots and come back at around Christmas!  LoL
